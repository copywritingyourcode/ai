AI: I am doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you today? 

(While this is a polite response, I'm ready to answer questions based on the documents I've been provided. I
can tell you about file formats, the document loading process, or even find information like the unique 
identifier.)

AI: I can load **PDF and TXT** files. After loading a document, I can 
answer questions about its content. 

Here's how it works: I convert your question into an embedding, search for 
similar content in the loaded document, retrieve the most relevant 
sections, and then use that information to generate a response. 

I can also tell you about the document loading process or find specific 
information within the document, like the unique identifier (which is 
XYZ123).

AI: I'm designed to work with the content of documents you provide, and 
answer questions *about those documents*. I can't tell jokes – I don't have
a knowledge base for that! 

I *can* tell you I can load **PDF and TXT** files and answer questions 
based on their content. Would you like to load a document and ask me 
something about *it*?
