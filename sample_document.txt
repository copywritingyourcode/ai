# Sample Document for Testing

This is a sample document that can be used to test the document loading functionality of the Local AI Assistant.

## Key Facts

- The Local AI Assistant can load PDF and TXT files.
- Documents are processed and stored in memory for quick reference.
- You can ask questions about loaded documents.
- The assistant uses vector embeddings to find relevant information.

## Example Commands

To load this document, use:
```
/load sample_document.txt
```

After loading, you can ask questions like:
```
What file formats can the assistant load?
What happens after I load a document?
How does the assistant find information in documents?
```

## Technical Details

The document loading process involves:
1. Reading the file content
2. Extracting text and metadata
3. Storing the document in memory
4. Generating embeddings for retrieval

When you ask a question about the document, the assistant:
1. Converts your question to an embedding
2. Searches for similar content in the document
3. Retrieves the most relevant sections
4. Uses this information to generate a response

## Test Section

This section is specifically for testing retrieval. If you ask about "unique identifier XYZ123", the assistant should be able to find this specific information in the document.

The unique identifier is: XYZ123. This is a randomly generated code for testing purposes.

The Local AI Assistant was developed in 2023 as an open-source project to provide private, local access to large language models.
