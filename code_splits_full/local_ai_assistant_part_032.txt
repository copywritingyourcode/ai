\f1\b Evaluation and Change.
\f0\b0  If 2028 was building steadily, 2029 tests what you\'92ve built. It\'92s a time to address any imbalance, especially between work and personal life. Some opportunity or situation may reach a turning point \'96 you might pivot your role, or a project concludes and you must decide \'93What next?\'94. The clash of Rooster and your Rabbit suggests a need to reconcile external demands with internal needs. It might feel like the world is not fully in sync with you this year, but that pressure can lead to breakthroughs if handled well.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Career & Wealth Opportunities:
\f0\b0  This year could bring 
\f1\b recognition with a twist
\f0\b0 . Perhaps you receive an award or bonus (Rooster likes to show off achievements), but it coincides with a decision to move on to a new challenge. You might surprisingly find yourself headhunted or considering a job at a different company. It\'92s a favorable year to update your career plan: ask, 
\f2\i am I where I want to be?
\f0\i0  If not, plot your move. Because of the clash with your day, you might feel an itch to break out of a rut. Some could experience a change in management or company direction that doesn\'92t sit well with them, prompting a change. If you\'92re content in your role, be prepared for a shake-up in team or structure \'96 not necessarily negative, but requiring adaptation. 
\f1\b Wealth:
\f0\b0  The previous Earth year likely improved your finances; 2029 is about 
\f1\b safe-guarding
\f0\b0 . Avoid major speculative investments or new debt. Instead, maybe diversify or put some money into safer instruments. Because there\'92s a clash affecting your personal pillar, keep personal and business finances cautious \'96 e.g., don\'92t entangle a personal property in a business deal this year. If you own a business, 2029 may present some cash flow hiccups or require unexpected expenses (equipment replacement, regulatory fees, etc.). Keep buffers and be nimble in budgeting. On the upside, if you\'92ve been eyeing selling an asset (like property or a side business), this year could be a good exit point to cash in gains, as clash can often mean entering a new phase (selling could free you for new ventures in the 2030s).\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Relationships:
\f0\b0  This is 
\f1\b perhaps the most sensitive area in 2029
\f0\b0  due to the Rooster-Rabbit clash directly hitting your \'93spouse palace\'94 (Day Branch). It doesn\'92t doom anything, but it signals you must prioritize harmony. There could be external stressors: perhaps one of you has to relocate for work, or a family member\'92s needs put pressure on your marriage. Misunderstandings can easily arise; little criticisms could cut deeper. 
\f2\i Think before speaking
\f0\i0  is the golden rule \'96 Rooster\'92s Metal tongue can be sharp. Also, make time for your partner; if you\'92ve been work-heavy in 2028, this is the year to rebalance. Consider a relationship tune-up: maybe a couples\'92 retreat or simply scheduled weekly date nights that are sacred (no work talk, no phones). If issues have been swept under the rug, they\'92ll surface now \'96 which is actually good for resolving them. Handle them with patience and empathy. For singles, be discerning \'96 Rooster year can bring attractive, shiny suitors, but not all that glitters is gold. You might attract or be attracted to someone who isn\'92t truly compatible long-term (perhaps very different values). Enjoy dating but avoid rushing into serious commitment until after the clash influence. If you meet someone wonderful and it\'92s solid, great \'96 just take it slow and ensure you see their real character. Friends might also challenge you this year \'96 possibly a conflict or drifting apart with a close friend. Try to resolve conflicts with open communication, but accept if some friendships have to evolve; it may make room for new connections that align better with who you\'92ve become.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Health & Well-being:
\f0\b0  Stress may manifest physically if you don\'92t address it. The tension of a clash can lead to headaches, anxiety spikes or even minor accidents due to distraction. 
\f1\b Holistic health
\f0\b0  approach is needed: maintain exercise (to release tension), mindfulness (to keep a cool head), and adequate rest. With two years of Earth influence in a row, watch your diet \'96 weight gain or digestive sluggishness could creep in if you\'92ve been too sedentary or eating on the go. Make adjustments: maybe try a new form of exercise in 2029 to keep yourself engaged (kickboxing or dance could be fun, bringing a bit of that Rooster showiness into play). Since Rooster rules the lungs and skin in TCM, keep an eye on respiratory health and skin conditions \'96 if you have allergies or asthma, ensure you have medications handy in transitional seasons. Also, given potential relationship or work stress, consider having a counselor or coach as an outlet to talk through issues \'96 mental health support is a strength, not a weakness.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Risks & Warnings:
\f0\b0  
\f2\i Conflict and Transition.
\f0\i0  The biggest risk is allowing a conflict (whether at work or home) to escalate to a breaking point. But remember, clashes often push necessary change; the key is 
\f2\i how
\f0\i0  you manage it. Don\'92t be stubborn (Earth\'92s downside) and cling to old ways that clearly aren\'92t working. Adapt. Also, avoid major life changes on impulse this year. If you feel the urge to, say, move to a new city or radically change careers, examine if it\'92s a genuine calling or just pressure speaking. It might be wise to make big decisions towards the 
\f2\i end
\f0\i0  of the year or in early 2030 when the clash energy wanes, unless you\'92re absolutely sure. Legally, keep everything straight \'96 Rooster likes precision, so file your taxes carefully, follow laws, avoid any shady shortcuts as they could easily backfire in a Metal year.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Recommended Actions:
\f0\b0  
\f1\b Rebalance and Resolve.
\f0\b0  Face any brewing issues head-on with a problem-solving mindset. In career, if you\'92re unhappy, update your CV and discreetly explore options; you could plan an exit strategy to execute in 2030 (which starts a new luck pillar for you, likely a timely fresh start). If you\'92re happy, then focus on adapting to changes and proving your value \'96 maybe volunteer for a task others are shying from; it can set you apart. Strengthen your professional network; someone in your circle could present a helpful opportunity or advice this year, especially if you consider a transition. For relationships, double down on communication: perhaps set a rule to eat dinner together tech-free every night, or similar, to ensure constant connection. Perform a 
\f1\b Feng Shui check
\f0\b0  at home: Rooster\'92s direction is West \'96 avoid loud renovations in the East-West axis this year to minimize clash vibes on your day branch. You might place something red in the East (your Rabbit direction) as a symbolic protection against the West\'92s Rooster energy, or a small mirror in the West to deflect negative Qi. These are subtle cures; the main cure is in behavior \'96 patience, understanding, and flexibility. By the end of 2029, you\'92ll likely have made some key decisions and cleared obstacles, setting the stage for a new chapter. Think of it as clearing out weeds (Rooster pecking away) so that in 2030 and beyond, you can plant new successes.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 2030 \'96 Year of the Metal Dog (\uc0\u24218 \u25100 )\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Elemental Overview:
\f0\b0  Yang Metal over Dog (Earth). A significant year as it likely marks the start of a 
\f1\b new 10-year Luck Pillar
\f0\b0  for you (around age 39). If our earlier calculation is right, you move into 
\f1\b Ren Yin (Water Tiger)
\f0\b0  around this time, but the exact start could be late 2030 or early 2031. Regardless, 2030 is a cusp year bridging old and new phases. The year itself brings strong Metal (Heavenly Stem Geng is potent Yang Metal) and Earth from the Dog branch. Dog is part of the same trio as your birth year Goat (Goat, Dog, Ox form an Earth penalty trio, as mentioned before). Two Earth years in a row (2028, 2029) now followed by a third Earth branch (Dog) might feel heavy, but the shift to a new Pillar with Water element on the horizon suggests a breaking of the drought. 
\f1\b Metal Dog
\f0\b0  year is about 
\f1\b responsibility, closure of past cycles, and laying groundwork for future ambitions
\f0\b0 .\

\f0\b0  
\f1\b Climax of a Chapter and Transition.
\f0\b0  Many long-running situations reach a head this year. You might finalize a major work project or even end a long tenure at a job (by choice or circumstance) ready to embark on something new in the incoming cycle. It\'92s a year where 
\f1\b leadership and duty
\f0\b0  weigh on you \'96 you might be entrusted with a big responsibility (e.g., running a department, completing a critical contract, or taking care of a family matter). At times it may feel burdensome, but it\'92s also an opportunity to prove yourself and solidify your legacy of this decade.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Career & Wealth Opportunities:
\f0\b0  With 
\f1\b Yang Metal
\f0\b0  present, career intensity is high. If you stayed with your company through the challenges of 2029, you could be stepping into a more authoritative role in 2030. Perhaps a difficult boss left, and you are asked to fill in, or the company pivots and you lead a new initiative. Embrace leadership \'96 even if you\'92re more comfortable as the idea person, this is the time to take charge. The Dog branch adds networking luck; Dogs are loyal and social, so building alliances at work is crucial. You might form a \'93dream team\'94 to tackle a big project, or if you started a new job, you\'92ll find colleagues rallying to support you as you settle in. 
\f1\b Wealth:
\f0\b0  The focus might be on large assets and security. It\'92s a good year to consider property matters: buying a home, investing in land, or renovating (with an eye to increase property value). Also, estate planning or insurance \'96 essentially safeguarding wealth \'96 is wise under Metal Dog\'92s responsible energy. You might not see dramatic income jumps this year (unless it comes with a promotion); it\'92s more steady, but expenses could be high if you\'92re transitioning (e.g., starting a business or moving). That\'92s okay if planned \'96 think of it as investing in your future. If you have business endeavors, 2030 is about 
\f1\b systematizing and formalizing
\f0\b0  them. Metal likes structure: ensure contracts, licenses, all paperwork are in order. It may be worth hiring legal or financial consultants to audit your setup so that as you grow into the next cycle, your foundation is rock solid.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Relationships:
\f0\b0  After the turbulence of 2029, 2030 feels more stable but serious. It\'92s a year to 
\f1\b reaffirm commitments
\f0\b0 . You and your partner could find yourselves on the same team facing an external challenge (like caring for an aging parent, or guiding a teenager through exams, or building that house together). This \'93us against the world\'94 dynamic can deepen your bond. Just be cautious not to let all interactions be about duty/business \'96 inject some fun occasionally (maybe Dog year brings a new pet into the family? That could add joy!). If you navigated 2029 well, trust between you is stronger now. Single individuals may feel less pressure this year \'96 the focus might tilt towards career, but through career and community (Dog), you could meet someone solid and trustworthy. Notably, if your partnership survived the last year\'92s clash, 2030 can be a great year to formalize things (if not yet married, you might decide to marry now, feeling confident in each other after weathering storms). Friendships and community will play a supportive role; you might reconnect with old friends (Dog loves loyalty and nostalgia) or become more involved in community groups, which also feeds your social needs beyond work.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Health & Well-being:
\f0\b0  
\f1\b Stamina and stress management
\f0\b0  remain crucial. Three Earth years continuously could have added some weight or fatigue; make 2030 the year you do a thorough health reboot. Consider a full physical and bloodwork to catch any issues. With Metal strong, pay attention to your joints and bones (as Metal corresponds to the lungs and also by extension affects the skin and structural aspects; Earth relates to muscles). If you feel stiff or notice posture issues from long hours working, invest in physiotherapy or a personal trainer to strengthen your body. Also, since Water luck is coming (which governs kidneys), start nurturing that in advance: ensure you\'92re keeping hydrated and maybe incorporate kidney-strengthening foods (black sesame, kidney beans, etc.) into diet by winter. This helps smoothly transition into next year. Mentally, because you may shoulder great responsibility, watch for 
\f1\b symptoms of burnout
