\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Would it be clich\'e9 to say that the new year, 2025, demands a new you? Maybe a little, but there\'92s a deeper truth here we should explore. Because I want to say that the only thing that changes between the years is the calendar, and while that is kind of true, the holiday period is certainly a transitional time of year.\
With people having time off work, spending time with friends and family and indulging in the luxuries of life a little (or a lot), the holiday period that marks the end of one year and the beginning of the next is not really an accurate reflection of one\'92s life. It\'92s a time of year when you have more time on your hands and a good excuse to spend some of the money you\'92ve been earning all year, not to mention everyone else is in the same position.\'a0
\f1\i What a combination.
\f0\i0 \
This makes the start of the new year a great moment for reflection.\'a0
\f1\i What does one do when they have both time and an excuse to spend money with the people closest to them?
\f0\i0 \
Though dare I even say it, such a time doesn\'92t last forever. 2025 is here now and the holiday period is about to turn into just another year.\
And what happens when all this rosy-cheeked joy turns back into everyday life?\'a0
\f1\i Will you be happy?
\f0\i0 \'a0Will you be living the life you really want to be living? Because now, and I mean now, 2025 is already here, is the moment to ask yourself about the year you\'92re about to have. Time waits for no man, as my father likes to say. Unfortunately he couldn\'92t be more correct. Time will not wait for you to make up your mind;\'a0
\f1\i it\'92ll waste every minute you have waiting for you to get clear about what you want.\'a0
\f0\i0 It\'92s ruthless like that.\
But it\'92s really not as simple as just thinking about what you want for 2025. You\'92ve got to know what you want from life in general, not just the new year, something a lot of people struggle with; it\'92s choice paralysis.\'a0
\f1\i Free will is a tremendous gift but it sure can be confusing at times.
\f0\i0 \
Though I\'92ve got a solution for you. Because while I certainly can\'92t tell you what you would like to see in your future, I can give you some direction on how to answer that question for yourself.\'a0
\f1\i Often the first step in working out what you want is to get clear about what you don\'92t want.
\f0\i0 \'a0And as we\'92re now in 2025, it\'92s time for a little trip back to 2024.\
You see, it doesn\'92t make much sense to reflect on years long since passed. We change as people over the years and maybe you genuinely have addressed some of the challenges from your past, but if you\'92re reading this around the new year then 2024 is only one year away at the most.\'a0
\f1\i Which means you can\'92t get away with the \'93it was in the past\'94 excuse because you just did it.
\f0\i0 \
The absolute clearest most concrete steps you can take in 2025 is to not do some of the things you did in 2024. It\'92s as simple as identifying, through reflection, some of the undesirable situations you found yourself in over the course of 2024, and then reminding yourself, ideally even putting a plan in place, to make sure that you do not relive those situations this year. And what\'92s fantastic about life is that they don\'92t have to return,\'a0
\f1\i but you need to make sure that happens, no one else.
\f0\i0 \
It\'92s your job to make sure you don\'92t end up with the same challenges you lived with last year.\'a0
\f1\i And that requires a change of behaviour, for those of you trying to wish your way to a better life.
\f0\i0 \
2024 is well and truly over, which means you\'92ve got everything you need to make sure 2025 is a better year. All you\'92ve got to do is do it now.\
But reflecting on the year which has since passed isn\'92t the full equation. Because reflecting will only help you avoid the bad, and one\'92s goals shouldn\'92t only be to run away,\'a0
\f1\i you need to learn to chase.\'a0
\f0\i0 Life is a push and a pull, and if you want to fully live life you will need to make sure you\'92re not just being pushed away from the bad, but also pulled towards the good.\'a0
\f1\i Which is where 2025 comes in.
\f0\i0 \
2025 is a new year, but it\'92ll only be new for so long. Just you wait, we\'92ll be talking about it in the past tense soon enough. And when 2025 is said and done,\'a0
\f1\i what are you going to have to show for it?
\f0\i0 \'a0You have to get clear about that now. And no, you don\'92t have to have it all worked out; this is a common misconception people have. Nobody can know exactly what they will want in the future. Life is full of twists and turns:\'a0
\f1\i desires change, wants change, motivations change, but most importantly, people change.
\f0\i0 \
And while one can\'92t know exactly what they will want in the future, one can certainly get clear on what direction they would like to go in now. Chasing a direction will give you the adaptability to change course if your desires change, which they usually do given enough time. Knowing your direction for 2025 is vital, because it\'92s going to give you a guide moving into the new year. Without one you\'92re gambling your year away to a melody of maybes.\
And guess what?\'a0
\f1\i There is no time better than right now to get clear on your direction.\'a0
\f0\i0 I like the idea of a new year\'92s resolution, but if we\'92re being honest the new year is really just a convenient excuse to do something you probably already should have been doing. And if the new year is what it takes to make that change happen, then I\'92m here for it. But you don\'92t need the new year to change anything, all you need is right now.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\i \cf2 It starts with a decision, then an action, and then a commitment to continued action.
\f0\i0 \'a0If you can do all three of these things, easier said than done sometimes, you are well on the way to making a real change in your life.\
This essay is about the crossing over from one year to the next, 2024 into 2025, but I really want to make it clear that now, whenever you\'92re reading this, is the only time that actually matters when it comes to making a change. Even if you\'92re reading this in 2026 or beyond, the point is that now is the time for change. However, if you are reading this over the new year, just know you\'92ve got a little extra motivation as you can use the new year as your excuse to be better.\'a0
\f1\i But, being better has nothing to do with the years and everything to do with you, so be better no matter what time of the year it is.
\f0\i0 \
2025 is here, you couldn\'92t go back even if you wanted to. So you need to get clear about what you want for this year if you haven\'92t already, because every day you wait is a day you don\'92t get back.\'a0
\f1\i The sooner you know what you want, or don\'92t want, the sooner you can start doing something about it.
\f0\i0 \
Back in the early months of 2024 I shared some motivational posts on my Instagram. These posts depicted how young the year was, the intention being to remind people of the potential that stood in front of them, to remind us that we had the entire year to make something happen.\'a0
\f1\i But it\'92s all gone now, just a memory.
\f0\i0 \'a0And did I use my time perfectly? Probably not, but I\'92m happy with what I did. I don\'92t look back and mourn at the lost time because I used it in a way that felt right to me. And really that\'92s the feeling I recommend you chase.\
You want to look back and feel that you used your time well, that you only wasted what was necessary and nothing extra. It\'92s not about being perfect, but about being your best. Something that will always involve wasting some time.\
Because the end of 2024 is not just the end of a year, the universe has many left and it\'92s really not worried about passing another one. More notably though,\'a0
\f1\i it\'92s the end of one of your years.\'a0
\f0\i0 We like to think of years as these universal things that apply to everyone, but truth be told, my 2024 and your 2024 are not the same in the context of our unique lives.\'a0
\f1\i The only thing we have in common is that we\'92re both a year closer to death.
\f0\i0 \
And come next year we\'92ll both be another year closer to the end. \'93Oh well, I have plenty of time left,\'94 a statement that gets less true with every day that passes.\
Reflecting on the past and planning for the future is really only about one thing:\'a0
\f1\i making the most of the limited time you have.
\f0\i0 \'a0Because you are going to grow old, and when you do, you don\'92t get to go back and do it all again; it\'92s already over.\'a0
\f1\i One day 2025 will be a memory seemingly just as distant as those of your childhood.
\f0\i0 \
So once again, trying to avoid the clich\'e9, you\'92ve got to live life as if it were already a memory.\'a0
\f1\i You\'92ve got to live a life you\'92re happy to look back on,
\f0\i0 \'a0because once this very temporary moment passes, the only thing you will have left is the memory of it. 2024 is now a memory, as will be 2025.\
